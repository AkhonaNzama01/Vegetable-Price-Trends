    "* **Purpose:**  \n",
    "   The purpose of this project is to analyze the time-series data of vegetable prices across various regions and periods. By exploring pricing trends, the project aims to provide insights that can be useful for farmers, consumers, policy makers, and market analysts in understanding how prices fluctuate over time. This can assist in forecasting, better planning, and strategic decision-making in agriculture and food markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Details:**  \n",
    "   - **Problem Domain:** Price volatility in agricultural markets can impact food security, economic stability, and decision-making for stakeholders. This project focuses on exploring the dynamics of vegetable prices.\n",
    "   - **Significance:** Tracking the historical price trends and identifying patterns can optimize supply chains, inform policy decisions, and predict future price movements.\n",
    "   - **Key Questions:**  \n",
    "     - What trends can be identified in vegetable prices over the given period?  \n",
    "     - Are there any specific vegetables that experience more volatility in price than others?  \n",
    "     - How can this data be used to forecast future vegetable prices?  \n",
